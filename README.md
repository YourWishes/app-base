# @yourwishes/app-base
My custom NodeJS App Framework base, all modules depend on this and extend it in some form.

## Roadmap

 1. Convert current modules from JavaScript to Typescript
 2. Write tests and confirm no bugs exist
 3. Write docs for modules
 4. Write docs for base app, as well as setup and integration strategies
